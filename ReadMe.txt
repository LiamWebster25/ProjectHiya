HOW TO USE:
You will need the project folder, Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension.
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code. Open the "home.html" file. Right click 
anywhere on the file and select "Open with Live Server" (If it is not installed, install 
the Live Server extension). You can go through the various pages liste above. Finally, we
have the admin page that is accessible in the footer of every page. If you click on the "admin"
href, it will take you to a page with 2 prompts. The first prompt is username: 'admin' and the 
password: 'password'. This will take you to the page with all of the records of contact messages.s
