SUMMARY: 

In this project deliverable, myself and Liam have decided to go for a safe and simplistic approach to web design by having simple, catchy
and smooth feel to the whole thing. 

HOME: 

For our home page, we went for a simple design where the first thing that catches your eye is the mattress against the wall video that you 
most likely felt inclined to click on as soon as you opened the page. This is exactly the intention of it as the video is designed to get 
the user more interested in what this gym has to offer. 

ABOUT:

We've decided to keep the same design for the about tab in order to not disrupt the user's experience. Simplicity is key for web design. 
We also have included an image to keep the user engaged. 

PRICE: 

Here we calculate the exact price with and without tax that a member must pay to keep access to the gym. 

SCHEDULE: 

We used a table for this page in order to provide a sleek schedule that the user is able to read with ease. 


CONTACT: 

If you wish to contact the gym owner, the contact page sends messages directly to the admin.html file that can be seen by clicking "Admin"
in the footer and logging in using the credentials: 

Username: admin
Password: password 

(we aren't concerned about security at this point in time)
