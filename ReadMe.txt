SUMMARY: 

In this project deliverable, myself and Liam have decided to go for a safe and simplistic approach to web design by having simple, catchy
and smooth feel to the whole thing. 

In the footer of every page is access to the admin page where you can see messages sent by the contact page. 

HOME: 

We have nothing very complex on this page. Just click on the video and enjoy the UI. 

ABOUT:

Access to the admin page via footer. 

PRICE: 

Here we calculate the exact price with and without tax that a member must pay to keep access to the gym. You MUST place a month about in the numericUpDown

SCHEDULE: 

We used a table for this page in order to provide a sleek schedule that the user is able to read with ease. 


CONTACT: 


You must fill out all of the forms in order to send the message and the email must contain an @ symbol


The contact page sends messages directly to the admin.html file that can be seen by clicking "Admin"
in the footer and logging in using the credentials: 


Admin:

Credentials
Username: admin
Password: password 

(we aren't concerned about security at this point in time)
